## Creating custom pages

Gridsome 0.6 comes with a new API for creating pages. Until now, you have only been able to create pages by having Vue components in the `src/pages` folder or by creating templates for content types. But that is too limited for some use cases. The new API lets you create pages programmatically, which will give you much more flexibility.

## Staters library

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Ad soluta ab autem deserunt at minima quod nulla, fuga praesentium ex tenetur, beatae ipsam pariatur, repudiandae error necessitatibus molestias? Aliquid, placeat.

#### Custom node fields as top-level options

Custom node fields have been created by adding a `fields` option when creating nodes.
