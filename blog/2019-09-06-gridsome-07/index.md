## Schema API

Gridsome generates the GraphQL schema for metadata and collections based on the data which is discovered on startup. That's great for simple projects but will often lead to errors with, for example missing fields because content has been removed in an external source. This API lets you define your own schema types to have persisted fields.

```js
api.loadSource(({ addSchemaTypes }) => {
  addSchemaTypes(`
    type Post implements Node {
      title: String
    }
  `)
})
```

**This will fix many problems** for data source plugins. Now Gridsome will know what data is really coming from a Source.

## New template configuration

Previously, each content type has been given a route in order to assign it to a template with the same name inside the `src/templates` directory. Routes were spread across many plugin options and some also hidden within plugins. **The new `templates` config tries to collect all content type routes in a single property in `gridsome.config.js`.**

To create a route for a [collection](/docs/collections) you simply add `CollectionName: '/any/route/:title'` to the new [templates](/docs/templates)  config. Here are some examples:

```js
// gridsome.config.js
module.exports = {
  templates: {
  	// These will look for and use src/templates/{collection}.vue
    Post: '/blog/:year/:month/:title/',
    Author: '/author/:name/',

    // Routes for source plugins are also added here:
    WordPressPost: '/blog/:year/:month/:day/:slug/',
    WordPressTag: '/tag/:slug/',

    // Collections can have multiple templates:
    Product: [
      {
        path: '/product/:slug/',
        component: './src/templates/Product.vue'
      },
      {
        path: '/product/:slug/reviews/',
        component: './src/templates/ProductReviews.vue'
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**This means: **
- [Source plugins](/plugins) & [Data store API](/docs/data-store-api) is only responsible for getting data into Gridsome as [Collections](/docs/collections).
- The new [Templates](/docs/templates) config are used to setup **templates and routes** for any collection.

## Dynamic routing

Dynamic routing is perfect to use if you need routes for, for example, user accounts or need to fetch data from an external source on client-side. (Data that will not be generated).

#### File-based dynamic routes

Dynamic pages is used for client-side routing. Route parameters can be placed in file and directory names by wrapping the name in square brackets. For example:

- `src/pages/user/[id].vue` becomes `/user/:id`.
- `src/pages/user/[id]/settings.vue` becomes `/user/:id/settings`.

At build time, this will generate `user/_id.html` and `user/_id/settings.html` and you must have rewrite rules to make them work properly on a static web host.

#### Programmatic dynamic routes

Create pages with dynamic routes programmatically for more advanced paths. Dynamic parameters are specified by having a `:` in front of a segment. And each parameter can have a custom regular expression to match only digits or certain values.

```js
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.createPages(({ createPage }) => {
    createPage({
      path: '/user/:id(\\d+)',
      component: './src/templates/User.vue'
    })
  })
}
```

## Custom App.vue

**App.vue** is the file that wraps your whole website or app. Gridsome usually adds a `App.vue` automatic in the background. This can now be overridden by having your own `App.vue` file in your `src` directory. Overriding it is useful if you want to have a **layout that is shared across all your pages.** Or if you want to have a `<transition>` component around the `<router-view>`.

Here is an example:

```html
<!-- src/App.vue -->
<template>
  <MainLayout>
    <transition>
      <router-view />
    </transition>
  </MainLayout>
</template>

<script>
import MainLayout from '~/layouts/Main.vue'

export default {
  components: {
    MainLayout
  }
}
</script>
```

## Breaking changes

This release should not have any breaking changes if you upgrade from v0.6. But there are some changes that might have consequences that we have not foreseen. No deprecated methods or options in v0.6 has been removed yet, and they will now be listed in the terminal.

#### Trailing slashes for pages and routes

For instance, routes for pages in `./src/pages` will have a trailing slash by default. This can be disabled with the [`permalinks`](/docs/config/#permalinkstrailingslash) config. And trailing slashes in routes are preserved when Gridsome generates paths for nodes.

**You should have a trailing slash in every route and static `<g-link>` paths if you are hosting the site on Netlify or Zeit Now etc. to avoid redirects.** For example:

```js
module.exports = {
  templates: {
    Post: '/post/:title/'
  }
}
```

```html
<g-link to="/about-us/">About us</g-link>
```

#### Renamed methods and GraphQL fields

There are some methods and GraphQL fields that have been renamed. Using the old names will not break your site, but will show deprecation notices in the terminal:

- Use `addMetadata()` instead of `addMetaData()`.
- Use `addCollection()` instead of  `addContentType()`.
- Use `metadata` instead of `metaData` in the GraphQL schema and project config.

#### Deprecated collection methods

The new [Schema API](/docs/schema-api/) is deprecating previous methods for customizing the schema:

- Use `addSchemaTypes()` instead of `collection.addReference()`.
- Use `addSchemaResolvers()` instead of `collection.addSchemaField()`.

#### New type for the `$id` variable

The `$id` variable in `<page-query>` for nodes has previously been a `String` type. Even though the `id` field in the schema was of type `ID`. But the `$id` input variable must also be a `ID` type from now on. Gridsome will fix the type for you automatically and show a deprecation notice untill you have updated the query.
