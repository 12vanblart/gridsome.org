excerpt: "A new static site generator baby is born. It's highly inspired by Gatsby.js (React based), but it's built on top of Vue.js. We have been working on it for a year and finally have a beta ready. You can expect this baby to grow up fast!"

#### There are so many Static Site Generators. Why another one?

We think Gridsome is a missing piece to the Vue.js ecosystem. What Gatsby.js does for React.js is a game changer in how we build websites. Gridsome is the Vue.js alternative. React.js is excellent, but we think Vue.js is more approachable for most web designers and devs getting started with JAMstack.

With Gridsome you get a **universal GraphQL layer** for all your connected data sources. It's like a single source of truth for your website data ready to be used in Gridsome. Connect to any CMS or APIs like Google Spreadsheet, Airtable, Instagram Feed, local markdown files, etc. This and Vue makes it extremely fun and fast to build websites. 

You don't need to know GraphQL or Vue to get started with Gridsome - It's a great way to get introduced to both.

Here is an example on how to query posts from the GraphQL layer in Gridsome inside a Vue component:


```html
<template>
  <Layout>
    <h2>Latest blog posts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li v-for="edge in $page.allWordPressPost.edges" :key="edge.node._id">
        {{ edge.node.title }}
      </li>
    </ul>
  </Layout>
</template>

<graphql>
query Blog {
  allWordPressPost (limit: 5) {
    edges {
      node {
        _id
        title
      }
    }
  }
}
</graphql>
```


The GraphQL layer and all the data can be explored in a local GraphQL playground. The playground can usually be explored by opening `https://localhost:8080/___explore`.




#### Perfect scores on Google Lighthouse - automagically üíö

One of the main goals of Gridsome is to make a framework that let you build websites that are optimized "out-of-the-box." It follows the [PRPL-pattern by Google.](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/) You don't need to be a performance expert to make fast websites with Gridsome. Your site gets almost perfect scores on Google lighthouse out-of-the-box. These are some of the performance steps that Gridsome takes care of:

- Image compressing & lazy-loading ‚ö°Ô∏è 
- CSS & JS minification ‚ö°Ô∏è 
- Code-splitting ‚ö°Ô∏è 
- HTML compressing ‚ö°Ô∏è 
- Critical CSS (Plugin) ‚ö°Ô∏è 
- Full PWA & Offline-support (plugin) ‚ö°Ô∏è  


#### A better way to build websites

Gridsome is a JAMstack framework - a new way to build websites that gives you better performance, higher security, cheaper hosting, and a better developer experience. While pages are static generated at build time, for SEO & speed purpose, you can add powerful dynamic functionality with Vue.js.

We believe the SSGs / JAMstack trend is just getting started. When you have first started to make websites this way there is no way back. You feel almost "dirty" when going back to a traditional WordPress / CMS setup. 

Try running the new Chrome Lighthouse (Audit tab in Developer tools) on a WordPress site - It is impossible to get good scores even with the best caching plugins and hosting. With Gridsome you don't even need caching plugins. Website optimization is taken care of at build time.

This is what we think is very exciting and is why we are building Gridsome. It is the **perfect SPA & PWA front-end solution** for any headless CMS or content APIs.


#### Whats next

In the next couple of months we're going to continue to improve the docs, create tutorials, add more source & transformer plugins and fix bugs.

The project is more mature than the version tells you, but we're starting here and try to get to 1.0 as fast as possible.

#### Contribute to Gridsome

We're currently just two brothers working on this, so any contribution is very welcome. We're passionate about building a faster web and make website building fun again.

You can also support us by giving [a star on GitHub](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome/stargazers) and spread the word :)
