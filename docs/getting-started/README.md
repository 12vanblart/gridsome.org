# Introduction

Gridsome lets you connect to any CMS, APIs, or local files, with source plugins to fetch data into a GraphQL layer so you can use the data anywhere in your Vue-components.

Each page generated by Gridsome has its own pre-rendered static HTML, providing world-class loading performance and is SEO-friendly. Once the page is loaded, however, Vue takes over the static content and turns it into a full Single-Page Application (SPA) - making it very fast to browse around without page reloads. Additional pages are fetched on demand as the user navigates around the site.

You don't need to know Vue or GraphQL before starting with Gridsome. It's a great framework learning both.


** It's highly inspired by the amazing GatsbyJS framework (ReactJS alternative). **


## Getting started

During the build, we create a server-rendered version of the site and render the corresponding HTML by virtually visiting each route. This approach is inspired by Nuxt's nuxt generate command and other projects like Gatsby.
