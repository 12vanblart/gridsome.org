# Quick start

Gridsome is a universal Vue.js framework powered by GraphQL. It uses GraphQL as a single source of truth for all data connected to the website. You can pull data from any CMS, local Markdown or content APIs into the GraphQL layer. Data can be explored in a local GraphQL playground and be inserted into any component quickly. 

Gridsome is heavily inspired by **Gatsby** (A React.js alternative).
